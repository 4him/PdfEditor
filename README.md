PdfEditor
=========

Its an open source project I developed as a final year project.It can be used to annotate the pdf in different ways like putting a circle,comment,square,tickmark,question marks,highlight etc.It basically focusses on the need of an examiner in order to evaluate a answer sheet submitted by student in form of pdf.It also stores all the marking,remarks,checking done by examiner and uses this data to determine the noraml checking pattern of examiner ,based on that it checks for the consistency that whether a student is a victim of wrong checking or not and generates a list of students who deviates from the noraml checking.
