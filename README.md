PdfEditor
=========

It is an open source project I have developed as a final year project. It can be used to annotate the pdf in different ways, like putting a circle, comment, square, tickmark, question marks, highlights etc. The basic focus of this project is on the need of an examiner in order to evaluate an answer-sheet submitted by a student in the form of a pdf. It also stores all the markings, remarks and checking done by the examiner and uses this data to determine the normal checking pattern of the examiner. Based on this data, it checks whether a student is a victim of wrong checking or not and generates a list of students who deviates from normal checking.
